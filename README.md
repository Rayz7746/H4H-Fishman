## Overview

This is a clone of the original [H4H-2025](https://github.com/StefanMerfy/H4H-2025) repository, created for the Hack for Humanity event. This project was developed in collaboration with friends as our contribution to the hackathon.
This repository uses Git Large File Storage (LFS) to manage all files efficiently, which necessitated creating a new clone from the original repository.
